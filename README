# PwnBuckets

PwnBuckets is a Bukkit plugin that aims to make the dissemination of
liquids, particular water, act in a more natural way. Basically, 
eliminating the "source" block and the infinite water pools. It 
also applies to lava blocks, ice blocks, buckets and dispensers. 
Using this plugin adds an extra element of realism and difficulty 
to the Minecraft experience.

## Installation

1. Stop your server.
2. Place the PwnBuckets.jar in your /plugins directory.
3. Start your server, note the /plugins/PwnBuckets/config.yml 
4. Stop your server.
5. Edit the /plugins/PwnBuckets/config.yml to your liking. 
   (Please note by default - all settings in our config are DISABLED)
6. Start your server.

Note: It is important to always test ANY plugin you install prior 
to deploying it for production, you as a server admin, should 
always consider this to be Rule 1 of running a server.
